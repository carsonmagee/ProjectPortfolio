# Music Database
This project was created using Structured Query Language within the SQLite Database Software. The main purpose of this project is to present the basic uses and key concepts of SQL through a music database. 

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to explore software other than MySQL, which I am more familiar with. I found the browser version of SQLite quite convenient.

## Features
10 queries are listed to make competent analysis of the chosen music database.

## Reflection
I found difficulty within the chosen database. It appeared, after downloading the database, that it was meant 
to hold multiple tables within the download, however, I could not find a way to parse the download into multiple tables.
