# Music Database
This project was created using Structured Query Language within the SQLite Online Database Software. The main purpose of this project is to present the basic uses and key concepts of SQL through a music database. 

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to explore software other than MySQL, which I am more familiar with. I found the online browser version of SQLite quite convenient, the only issues I had were sourced from the database I used. 

## Features
10 queries are listed to make competent analysis of the chosen music database.

## Reflection
I found difficulty within the chosen database. It appeared, after downloading the database, that it was meant 
to hold multiple tables within the download, however, I could not find a way to parse the download into multiple tables.

## Installation
Download the music.db database from [CORGIS Project Site](https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/music/)  
Open [SQLite Online](https://sqliteonline.com/)
Click File >Open DB <img src="https://github.com/carsonmagee/ProjectPortfolio/assets/24598567/9d61ee3a-7b51-4f6e-8df4-bb0e97b82707" width="200" />
Select the music.DB file from your downloads <img src="https://github.com/carsonmagee/ProjectPortfolio/assets/24598567/439ff957-3dfd-492d-87e1-d35da9f22452" width="200" />
Copy and past the queries (found below in the tests section) into the text box within SQLite Online. All tests and their screenshots can be found below.
