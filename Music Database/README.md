## Overview

This SQL project presents the basic uses and key concepts of SQL. 

## Reflection

I found most of my difficulty within the software and the given database table. 
I am normally use mySQL for all of my queries, so it was a bit challenging to 
change software to sqlite. 

A big portion of my issues with the software was actuallydue to the construction
of the given table. It appeared, after downloading the table, that it was meant 
to hold multiple tables within the download, however, I could not find a way to parse
the download.

- What worked well and what was a struggle? 
  - Coming up this thoughtful questions.
- What concepts still aren't quite clear?
  - I am unsure why part of the downloaded database does not have data.(such as the "song.titles" column)
- What techniques did you use to make your code easy to debug and modify?
  - I separated my query into multiple lines for readability.
- What would you change about your design process?
  - No, but I may change the software used.
- If you could go back in time, what would you tell yourself about doing this project?
  - The given databse is not perfect, so expect your questions to change.
