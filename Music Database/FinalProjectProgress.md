Only prior knowledge was used.

What have you accomplished? 
I have accomplished the entire project as far as I am aware. The entirety of the required 10 question word document is complete.

What's left to do by the time the final project is due? When are you going to finish the last parts?

Nothing is left to accomplish. I will take this week to revise anything that is necessary.
