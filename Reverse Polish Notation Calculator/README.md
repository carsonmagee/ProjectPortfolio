# Reverse Polish Notation Calculator

This project is a fully functional version of a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Calculator, created using native C++ programming in the command line.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to implement a calculator that uses postfix notation for arithmetic operations, demonstrating the use of stack data structure and native C++ code.

## Features

This project is a skeleton of a Reverse Polish Notation Calculator, including all of the original features. This means the code is highly manageable and can easily have a more robust Graphical User Interface added on, as well as more in-game capabilities.

## Installation

### Windows:

Follow this tutorial to setup a C++ environment: [Visual Studio Code - C++ and Mingw-w64](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw)  
Then continue with the following Linux code.

### Ubuntu and Linux

## Tests

An example equation looks like this: `123.45 67.4 + 18.34 *`
